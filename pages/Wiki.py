       ## Page 3: Chat Bot Integration

    Welcome to the Chat Bot Integration page! This section seamlessly integrates a chat bot into the Technical Analysis and Backtesting Dashboard, enhancing your interactive experience. The chat bot has been trained on the project's wiki, providing information and assistance related to the tool. Here's a breakdown of the functionalities:
    
    1. **Chat Bot Introduction:**
    
    - To initiate interaction with the chat bot, click the "Assistant" section. The bot is designed to answer questions and provide insights about the project.
    
     2. **Conversation Management:**
    
    - Use the "Note" tab to understand more about the chat bot. It has been trained on the project's wiki, and conversations can be saved in JSON format using the alternate tab.
      
    - In the "Save Conversation" tab, you can download and upload conversation sessions. This feature enables you to revisit and continue conversations at a later time.
    
    3. **Local Deployment:**
    
    - The chat bot operates locally, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience. Both the embedding model and the LLM (Language Model) are hosted locally, minimizing performance issues related to traffic and question complexity.
    
    4. **Langchain LLM Configuration:**
    
    - The Langchain LLM (Language Model) is configured to operate with OpenAI. The API base is set to 'http://144.172.137.100:1234/v1', and the API key is set to "NULL."
    
    5. **Text File Upload:**
    
    - To enhance the chat bot's knowledge, a text file named 'TA_DB.txt' is utilized. Make sure to provide a valid path to a text file for the tool to continue.
    
    6. **Text Processing:**
    
    - The tool processes the text from the specified file, splitting it into chunks for efficient handling. The LocalAIEmbeddings model is used for creating embeddings.
    
    7. **Knowledge Base Building:**
    
    - The FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is employed to build a knowledge base using the generated embeddings. This knowledge base assists the chat bot in providing relevant responses.
    
    8. **User-Chat Interaction:**
    
    - User and assistant messages are displayed, allowing you to see the ongoing conversation. Each message can be deleted individually by clicking the "Delete Message" button.
    
    9. **User Input and Chat Bot Response:**
    
    - The chat bot prompts the user with "What is up?" and awaits a response. Upon receiving the user's input, the chat bot processes the question, performs a similarity search, and utilizes the Langchain QA chain to formulate a response.
    
    10. **Assistant's Response Display:**
    
    - The assistant's response is displayed with a typewriter effect, enhancing the user experience. The conversation is updated, and you can continue interacting with the chat bot.
    
    Feel free to explore the capabilities of the chat bot and leverage it for additional insights into the Technical Analysis and Backtesting Dashboard!
